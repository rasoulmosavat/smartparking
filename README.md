Due to the increase in the number of cars, finding a place to park has become more and more difficult and complicate (Especially in big cities), which has many consequences such as increased pollution, traffic, wasted time and wasted car fuel. This project tries to solve the problem of finding parking for drivers by introducing and implementing a model of smart parking project.

This project consists of three main parts. 1- Application 2- Camera 3- Sensors 1-Application: The application section that allows drivers to view parking lots by name and address and the number of empty parking spaces in each parking lot. Drivers can also choose the best route by using the online traffic road map of city roads

2- Camera: After entering the parking lot, the license plate is scanned by the camera and if the license plate is registered by the driver in the program, a message with the following specifications will be displayed in the driver panel. Parking name, parking address, arrival time And when the driver leaves the parking lot, the license plate is checked again and the car parking information in the parking lot is updated. And the customer sees the following information in his application. Parking name, parking address, arrival time, exit time, parking fee The driver can pay for parking or pay monthly.

3- Ultrasonic sensors: The number of empty parking spaces in each parking lot is determined by ultrasonic sensors. A sensor is placed in each parking space and sends the status of the parking space (empty or full) to the server every 5 minutes. Then the number of empty parking spaces in each parking lot on the server is updated.

This project has four main components (Technical discuss). 1- Application 2- Camera 3- Sensors 4- API
